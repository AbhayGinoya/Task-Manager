# Task-Manger
This app allows users to register, log in, and manage tasks using Firebase authentication. Tasks are stored locally Drift for offline access and synced with Firebase when the internet is available. Updates can only be made to pending tasks, with WorkManager ensuring sync when offline changes are made.
